# roppy


A Pwning toolkit which allows you to interact with local process and network and lighten up your work during pwn. I made this in order to get the better understanding of python so that I could learn pwning more and this is one of my best project so far.


### Documentation

Although I'm working on do a documentation readthedocs but working alone on this project is very tiresome so I have to work 2x times of usual work and on the side work I have to learn about Pwning more.

For the time being, the documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/D4mianWayne/roppy/wiki/)
